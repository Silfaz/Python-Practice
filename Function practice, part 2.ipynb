We would like to generate a function that takes an input DNA sequence (consisting of the characters A, T, G and C) and replaces a character at a random position with another random character (from a pool of A, T, G and C). However, we only want to exchange it for a character that has not previously been in that position (so e.g. no A for an A). \n",

    "\n",
